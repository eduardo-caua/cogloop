# /specpilot.implement

Implement the next ticket from the **Ready** column and ship it.

> Works with tickets created by either `/specpilot.refine` (board-first) or `/specpilot.specify` (spec-first) — both land in **Ready** with a linked spec branch.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` may contain:
- `--once` — process one ticket then stop
- `--dry-run` — show which ticket would be picked, do nothing
- `--from <step>` — resume from a specific step: `implement`, `review`, `test`, `ship`, `merge`

## Steps

### 0. Load config
Read `.specpilot.json` from the project root. If missing, tell the user to run `/specpilot.setup` first and stop.

From config, identify:
- **Spec location**: the repo/folder with `role: "spec"` — read-only during implement
- **Feature repos**: all repos with `role: "feature"` — implement, test, build, and ship these
- Per repo: check `implement`, `test`, `build`, and `waitForCI` flags

### 1. Pick ticket
- Query the GitHub Project for the next ticket in the **Ready** column: `gh project item-list <projectNumber> --owner <owner> --format json`
- Filter items where `status` exactly matches `config.statuses.ready` (read from `.specpilot.json` — do NOT hardcode "Ready" or any other string)
- If `assignee` is set in config, additionally filter by that assignee
- If no tickets found, say "No tickets in Ready. All done!" and stop
- If `--dry-run`, print the ticket title and stop
- Move the ticket to **In Progress** (use `config.statuses.inProgress` value)
- Assign the ticket to `config.github.assignee` using `gh project item-edit` with the assignee field (if `assignee` is set in config)

### 2. Read spec
- Find the open PR (or branch) in the spec location for this ticket (e.g. branch `012-feature-name`)
- Check out that branch in the spec location
- Locate the spec directory: check both the root of specsDir and any app subfolders (e.g. `specsDir/member/012-feature-name/`, `specsDir/012-feature-name/`). Use whichever location contains the spec files.
- Read `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md`
- The spec location is **read-only** at this stage — do not commit yet

### 3. Checkout feature branches
For each feature repo (`role: "feature"`):
- `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
- `git checkout -b <branch-name>` (same branch name as the spec branch)

### 4. Implement
Run `/speckit.implement <branch-name>` from `speckit.workspaceDir`.
Only repos with `implement: true` (default) receive code changes.
Repos with `implement: false` still get a PR but no speckit changes.

### 5. Code review
Review changes in each feature repo for:
- Correctness against spec requirements
- Adherence to project constitution (if `.specify/memory/constitution.md` exists in the spec location)
- Test coverage
- No obvious bugs or security issues

Apply any fixes found.

### 6. Test and build
For each feature repo:
- If `test` is set → run it (up to 3 attempts, apply fixes on failure)
- If `build` is set → run it (up to 3 attempts, apply fixes on failure)
- If still failing after 3 attempts, report the error and stop

### 7. Ship — commit, push, open PRs
For each feature repo with changes:
- `git add -A && git commit -m "<ticket title>"`
- `git push origin <branch-name>`
- `gh pr create --title "<ticket title>" --body "Closes #<issue-number>"`

### 8. Wait for CI
For each open PR:
- If `waitForCI: false` → skip, proceed to merge
- If `waitForCI: true` → actively monitor CI status:
  1. Run `gh pr checks <pr-number> --repo <owner>/<repo>` to get the current status
  2. If all checks pass → proceed to merge
  3. If any check fails → attempt to fix the code and push again (up to 2 attempts)
  4. If checks are still pending/in progress → tell the user the current status, wait 30 seconds, then check again. Repeat this loop up to 60 times (30 min total).
  5. If no checks are reported after the first poll → treat as pass and continue
  6. If still running after 30 min → ask: *"CI is still running. Wait longer or merge anyway?"*

  **Do NOT stop or hang after pushing.** You must actively run the `gh pr checks` command repeatedly until you get a definitive result (pass or fail).

### 9. Merge all PRs
Merge feature repos first, then spec location last:
- `gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch`

If spec is a folder inside the project (not a separate repo), commit and push directly to main instead.

### 10. Add comment to issue
Post a comment on the GitHub Issue:
```
PRs merged:
- [repo-name#N](url)
- [spec-repo#N](url)
```

### 11. Move ticket to Done
- Update ticket status to the value of `config.statuses.done` in the GitHub Project
- Ensure `config.github.assignee` is still assigned to the ticket

### 12. Continue or stop
- If `--once`, stop
- Otherwise ask: *"Implement next ticket? (yes/no)"*
- If yes, go to Step 1. If no, stop.

## Error handling
- If any step fails, report clearly with the step name and error
- Do not move to Done unless all PRs are merged
- On CI failure: attempt fix and repush before giving up
- On merge conflict: pull latest main, rebase the feature branch, then retry
